  o  minor documentation cleanup

Changes in Version 2.0

  o  functions implementing the ti and tis classes were split off into their
     own package called "tis", which this package depends on.

  o  The remote Fame and client-server functionality was removed due to security
     concerns and because the Rserve package offers a better way to do this.

  o  It works with Windows FAME!

  o  The addLast() function that modified the .Last function in the global
     environment was a bad idea.

  o  The functions hexidecimal and hex2numeric were unnecessary, as the same
     things can be accomplished with sprintf() and evaluating hex strings with
     "0x" pasted on the front.
