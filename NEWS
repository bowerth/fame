Changes in Version 2.9

  o should now work with Fame 'master/dbback' Fame servers. 

Changes in Version 2.8

  o functions fameWhat, fameWhats and getfame return then entire documentation and
    description attributes, not just the first 256 characters.

Changes in Version 2.7

  o Thanks to Paul Gilbert (with an assist from Duncan Murdoch) for coming up
    with a Makevars.win file that actually works.  The Windows build works again!

  o For formula series, get description and documentation attributes from the
    formula, not from the series that results from evaluating the formula.

Changes in Version 2.6

  o minor changes to documentation

Changes in Version 2.5

  o fixed getFamePath() to use file.access() function rather than hope that
    the operating system knows what the "test" program is supposed to do.

Changes in Version 2.4

  o  minor documentation cleanup

Changes in Version 2.0

  o  functions implementing the ti and tis classes were split off into their
     own package called "tis", which this package depends on.

  o  The remote Fame and client-server functionality was removed due to security
     concerns and because the Rserve package offers a better way to do this.

  o  It works with Windows FAME!

  o  The addLast() function that modified the .Last function in the global
     environment was a bad idea.

  o  The functions hexidecimal and hex2numeric were unnecessary, as the same
     things can be accomplished with sprintf() and evaluating hex strings with
     "0x" pasted on the front.
